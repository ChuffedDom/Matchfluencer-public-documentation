Connecting establishing e-comm brands with up-and-coming influencers.

## Our Vision
As professional and personal brands look to grow and succeed, Matchfluencers aims to build a place where people can get closer to quitting the hum-drum 9-5 for their own personal endeavours.

We will accomplish this by setting up micro brand deals between e-commerce store owners to increase their audience, and influencers looking to fund their content creation.

Together we win.
